.SH DESCRIPTION
.I CONQUER
is a multi player computer game designed to run under the UNIX
operating system.  In
.I CONQUER,
each player is the leader of a nation,
composed of people (humans, orcs, elves, dwarves), recourses, and land.
Rulers customize their nation at creation by chosing their race and by giving
their nation special powers (magic, combat factor, location, speed...)
and resources (civilians, troops, iron, gold...).  Play involves building,
moving, and controlling armies and navies, diplomacy with other players,
and adjusting economic activity, which is primarily geared to the production
of gold for your treasury.  Iron is needed, however to build ships & armies,
and food is needed to prevent revolts and keep people alive.

.SH BUGS
Probably lots, if you find any please mail them to homxc!smile.

1) Security is not as tight as it should be.  People might be able to alter
the data of others nations... this is cheating and unacceptable. 
.br
2) Naval battles do not handle capturing merchant ships correctly.
.br
3) NPC nations can not build navies or move over water.  God should be
sure that all NPC nations have a minimum of 5 sectors to move to.
