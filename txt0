                    Welcome to Conquer XVERSION

CONQUER is a multi player computer game designed to run under the UNIX
operating system.  In CONQUER,  each player is the leader of a nation,
composed of people (humans, orcs, elves, dwarves), resources, and land.
Rulers customize their nation at creation by chosing their race and by giving
their nation special powers (magic, combat factor, location, speed...)
and resources (civilians, troops, metal, gold...).  Play involves building,
moving, and controlling armies and navies, diplomacy with other players,
and adjusting economic activity, which is primarily geared to the production
of gold for your treasury.  Also, metals are needed to build ships & armies,
and food is needed to prevent revolts and keep people alive.

Command line format: conquer [-hs -nNAT -dDIR]
                -h       print this help text
                -s       print out scores
                -n NTN   run as nation NTN
                -d DIR   run on data in directory DIR
It is suggested that each player set up a shell alias for their game & nation
The game administrator should read documentation on using the conqrun command.

                       A TYPICAL FIRST TURN

This section is offered to help beginning players understand the first
turns of the game.  The objective at this point is to take land and to
make enough farms that your people don't starve.  The first thing to do is
to look at sectors you can see (using the cursor keys).  You
are looking for sectors with high (4+) food/metal/jewel values.  You should
now assign soldiers to army groups (via. the Escape / G sequence). An army
group id is the same as a leader id.  Then, pick an army or army group with
the 'p'ick  command and 'm'ove it to a target sectors.  When you stop the
army, it should take the sector, and you should be able to see a little bit
more of the world.  Every army should try to take a different sector each
of the first few turns.  'r'edesignate sectors to farms (f),mines (m), or
goldmines ($).  Now browse the other reports and forms to get a feel of the
game.  When done, quit via the 'q'uit command.  After the update,
civilians will have moved into your sectors, and will start producing.
Watch that food consumption early on!!!
END
                            FINAL COMMENTS

To my knowledge Conquer runs well on UNIX (SYS V or BSD 4.3) systems.  The
game treats turns like a hidden move wargame would...  you enter all your
moves and the program and the program tells you what happens.  Like wargames, 
there is no turning back.  Every move you make will be saved when you quit.
If you goof up real bad, you need to go to the administrator, and have him
log in (as god) and fix whatever you did.  

Have Fun

The Ed

DONE
