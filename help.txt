                    Welcome to Conquer XVERSION

CONQUER is a multi player computer game designed to run under the UNIX OS.
In CONQUER,  each player is the leader of a nation, composed of people 
(humans, orcs, elves, dwarves), resources, and land.  Rulers customize their 
nation at creation by chosing their race and by giving their nation special 
powers (magic, combat factor, location, speed...) and resources (civilians, 
troops, iron, gold...).  Play involves building, moving, and controlling 
armies and navies, diplomacy with other players, and economics, which is 
geared to raising of gold for your treasury,  iron for ships & armies, jewels,
and food to prevent revolts and keep people alive.

Command line format: conquer [-hs -nNAT -dDIR]
		-h       print this help text
		-s       print out scores
		-n NTN   run as nation NTN
		-d DIR   run on data in directory DIR

Each player should set up a shell alias to run their nation.  The Game 
Administrator should read other documentation on using the admin command.
END
	                         THE WORLD

The Conquer world is very bloody, and a player needs skills at war gaming,
diplomacy, and building an economy to succeed.  Rival races are constantly
at war, and the world starts filled with player nations, random peoples
(lizard men in their cities of gold, barbarians, nomads, pirates, brigands),
and both hostile and friendly computer controlled non player countries.
Conquer can be played solitaire.  The computer uses an highly intelligent
movement algorithm to run the armies and navies of these non player
countries (NPC), and has intelligent algorithms built in that control these
nations diplomacy, construction, and economies.  You can find NPCs allied with
you against a common enemy,  but can also suddenly be stabbed in the
back and find hostile NPC armies at your doorstep.

	              WHAT IS WHAT IN THE WORLD

The world is composed of a 2 dimensional map of sectors, created by the
computer at the beginning of the game.  Each sector has about 10 unique
characteristics (altitude, gold, vegetation...).

SECTOR ELEVATIONS include:
	ZMOUNTAIN	ZHILL	ZCLEAR
	ZWATER	ZPEAK
SECTOR VEGETATION
Uninhabitable Areas (do not produce food and people simply do not like)
	ZVOLCANO	ZDESERT	ZJUNGLE
	ZTUNDRA	ZICE		ZSWAMP
Inhabitable (people like, number is relative value of food production)
	ZGOOD...9	ZFOREST...3 (4 ELF)	ZLIGHT...6
	ZWOOD...7 	ZBARREN...4 (3 ELF)

CONQUER is designed so each race likes their appropriate terrain.  Elves like
woods & forests,  Humans like good & light vegetation, and Orcs and Dwarves
like hills and mountains.  You can only redesignate inhabitable sector types.

	                      RACES OF THE WORLD

ORC       'O'   Poor at combat but they reproduce like mad (they can go over
	         10% reproduction ceiling). Orcs are lousy fighters and are
	         led by minor monsters (they start with MINOR MONSTER power).
ELF       'E'   Great at defense and quick, but few in numbers.  They start
	         with VOID power, which is perhaps the most potent power in the
	         game, but which costs them an extra distribution point.
DWARF     'D'   Dwarves are good at combat, but slow and few in numbers.  They
	         start with MINER power, which allows them to quickly mine
	         iron/jewels, and thus build up their combat skills and powers.
HUMAN     'H'   Humans start average at everything -- with reasonable numbers,
	         of people, and WARRIOR power, which gives them +10% in combat.
	         They have OK reproduction and good movement.
LIZARD    'L'   (NPC only)  An ancient race bound to their cities of gold
PIRATE    'P'   (NPC only)  Wandering pirates/brigands intent on plunder
NOMAD     'N'   (NPC only)  Will the wandering nomads tribes leave you alone?
BARBARIAN 'B'   (NPC only)  Indigenous natives
END
	                 POSSIBLE SECTOR DESIGNATIONS

ZMINE   Produces 100*Iron*People Talons + Produces Iron Ores
ZFARM   Produces 100*Vegetation*People Talons + Produces Food
ZGOLD   Produces 100*Gold*People Talons + Produces Jewels
ZCASTLE   Fortified Cities of the Lizards (only)
ZDEVASTATED   devastated sector
ZTOWN   Towns and Capitols are the bases of your power and are
ZCAPITOL   the only places you can draft soldiers or construct ships.
	Drafting only works if the sectors population is greater than your
	total civilians divided by the quantity 16+(number of sectors)/2.
	Towns give 750 talons per person and Capitols give 1000 talons per
	person.  Towns and Capitols cost more to redesignate.  To capture a
	Town or Capitol, you must be the only occupant when the world is
	updated.

The minimum permissible vegetation to redesignate a sector is XDESFOOD.
END
	                   	IRON, FOOD, AND GOLD

FOOD:      You MUST have enough food to feed your people... One civilian eats
	 one unit of food, and one soldier eats two units.  If you run out of
	 food, half the difference of people in Towns die.  Your Granary
	 will store 3x your civilian population in food.  The remainder
	 is converted to gold talons at a rate of 1 per food point.
IRON:      You need to have iron to draft new military, as per the unit types
	section.  One person produces one iron per point of mineral in
	 the sector per turn.  An amount of Iron (based on the number of troops
	 you have) can be used to buy +1% in your nations attack or defense.
JEWELS:    You can have a maximum of 10 talons debt for every jewel
	 point that you mined.  After that point, you undergo a TAX REVOLT,
	 which has not yet been implemented. Thus gold can be negative to
	 a certain level.  Jewels are also used in magic, and 100000 Jewels
	 will buy you one random new power (command M) (it doubles for each
	 power though).  You can have 10 talons in the treasury for each jewel
	 (gold based economy).  After that, your gold talons will be converted
	 to jewels at a 10:1 ratio.

	                   SCORING & CHARACTER CLASSES
Each nation has a types (classe), which is choosen when it it is created, and
which determines how Victory points are received.  Some classes start with
powers and have a starting cost. Warlord/Monster powers get all the prerequisite
powers, and thus starting cost can varies.

				VIEWING THE WORLD

When you log in, you will notice that you can only see a part of the
world.  You must discover the world by getting certain magical powers,
by taking land, or by moving armies and navies.  The use of SCOUT armies
is intended for this purpose.

The 'd' command allows you to change what you see on the map.  You can
alter the information in the sector and can  change the type of sectors that
are highlighted as follows:

information:  (d)esignation, (r)ace, (m)ove cost, (p)eople, (D)efense
        (f)ood, (c)ontour, (v)egetation, (i)ron, (n)ation mark, (j)old

highlight options:
	(o)wner (a)rmy (y)our Army (x)=none (M)ove left

I have tried to make the use of these options clear and self explainatory.
END
	                 POSSIBLE ARMY STATUS

MARCH    :Marching doubles army movement at the expense of combat strength.
SCOUT    :Scouts avoid any enemy, if possible, and can move through hostile
	 :   armies, but must have less than 25 men per army and can not take
	 :   even unowned land.  They are useful to check out the  map and
	 :   to determine the enemy combat strength.  You must draft scouts
	 :   as you can not split scouts from an army.
ATTACK   :Armies in this mode can take owned sectors, initiate
	 :   combat, and have they reasonable movement rates.
DEFEND   :In this mode, can take owned sectors and have good defense
	 :   and movement, but can not initiate combat.
GARRISON :This mode offers the strongest defense but is used only in Towns,
	 :   Capitol, and castles.  Garrisons may not move.

Note: It takes the greater of 75 and total soldiers/150 men to take a sector.
Your attack bonus increases by 5% if you take over a non player country.

			SHIPS AND SHIP COSTS

		crew	build cost	maintain cost	capacity
Warship		XSHIPCREW	XWARSHPCOST		XSHIPMAINT		0
Merchant	XSHIPCREW	XMERSHPCOST		XSHIPMAINT		XSHIPCP

Ships will now have crews - which, in addition to being drafted upon
construction, represent the ships current level of damage and are replaced,
in harbor, by using the construct ships command.  Movement of
a fleet is reduced if the crews are not full.  Marine or Sailor Armies
can also be carried by navies with warships.  Each fleet may carry one army
in addition to any troops that are ferried - who dont count in combat.
Marines add to chances of success in shipboard combat.

Ships permit rapid relocation of armies & civilians to strategic points.  Their
movement is 3x your nations maximum movement, and they only pay 1 move point 
per sector (coast lands), 4 in deep water, 4 in your harbor, and the min of
10 and all their remaining points points for non harbor coastlands.  Naval 
combat has not been adequately play tested, and Sailor units dont work.
END
			COMMERCE AND TRADING

Trading makes it be possible to exchange items between nations.

There are seven types of items available for trade:  gold, food, iron,
jewels, land, soldiers, and ships.  To place an item up for trade,
the player need only select the sell option on the commerce board.  The
player will then enter the type and amount of his product followed by the
type and minimum amount of what he wants in return.  The product will
remain on the commerce board until it is purchased or removed by the
owner of the product.  To purchase an item, a player can just select the
item number to purchase and then enter a bid amount.  You may only trade
mercenary, seige engine, catapult, (summoned) monster, or elephant units.

During every update, bids will be resolved and the highest bid for a
product will receive the product.  There is a 20% administration fee
for a trade (i.e. 20% of the traded goods on each side disappear)
END
	                         MAGIC POWERS
Magic powers differentiate your nation from all the other nations in the
world.  There are three types of powers - truely MAGICAL powers, which
usually involve summoning or spell use, CIVILIAN powers, which are related
to civilization and trade, and MILITARY powers, which measure your ability
to make war.  All nations start with at least one power (based on race or
class) and can purchase additional powers by expending jewels.  The formula
for this is to take two to the power of the sum of the number of powers you
have from that type and half the number of other powers times your base value:

jewel cost for civilian power = Base * 2**( #mgk/2 + #civ + #mil/2 )

				type of power desired
race			magical		civilian	military
	elves -		50K		50K		50K
	dwarves -	80K		40K		40K
	humans -	100K		25K		50K
	orcs -		100K		50K		25K

for example a human with 1 of each power wanting a magic power would pay
		50* 2**(1+1/2+1/2)=200K jewels

			SUMMONED MONSTERS

Monsters can be summoned via the magic menu if you have the SUMMON power.
A monster unit represents one monster, but is the equivalent in combat of an
army of the given number of men.  When summoned, they appear in your Capitol,
and are yours to command until you disband them or can not afford to pay
their per/turn jewel cost *and* 5x that cost in gold.  Monsters may be
wounded in combat as can normal army units.  Wounded monsters have a percent
chance of dying based on the percent damage taken (a dragon (1000 men) taking
200 equivalent men of damage has a 20% chance of dying).  Next turn, however
its strength will be fully restored (1000 men again).

Spell points are accumulated by having the SUMMON/WYZARD/SORCERER power.
Spell points can accumulate from turn to turn, but there is a 25% chance
that half your unused spell points dissappear each turn... Gives you some
incentive to use them.

	                    	NOTES ON COMBAT

Losses per unit are inversely proportional to a units combat bonus.

You can expect to take several turns to reduce a large army, especially
	 on a Town or Capitol.  NPC defenders will draft new troops each turn

The only method to take an occupied Town or Capitol is to be the the only
	 army in the sector when the combat is *over*.

THE NEXT PAGE IS THE COMBAT RESULTS TABLE
	 basically the attacker wants a high roll and the defender wants low.
         The table is based on a roll between 0 and 200 (it does NOT use true
         percentages).  The number given is the percent loss, which is modified
         by the armies attack or defensive bonus.  Retreats are based on the
         relative losses taken by a given side.

	                 FINAL HINTS & OTHER COSTS

It is important to initially have a reprorate of 9-10% and a move of ~8-9.
You need about 1000 military to start - to take enough new land.
Take as much land as possible in the beginning.
Make sure your combat bonus stays respectable.
Diplomacy with non player nations is important as it determines if you get 
	attacked or not.  Bribing NPCs is a good way to get some breathing room.
	You waste your money if you are at war with them that turn.

				OTHER COSTS

		Designation Costs:		$XDESCOST
		Designation to Towns/Capitol:	20x$XDESCOST+$XDESCOST IRON
		Fortification:			$XFORTCOST*(2**Fort Level)
		Bribe Nation:			$XBRIBE/level
		Move Civilians:			$50/civilian
END
				OTHER NOTES

   The computer can move for players if they dont enter a turn and the
CMOVE variable is set before the program is compiled.  This works well... 
for a time.  The Computer will NOT redesignate captured sectors for you.

Mercenaries must be paid a discharge fee equal to enlistcost when disbanded.

If you have too many people in a given non Town, non capitol sector, 
reproduction and production is halved for them.  If you have a huge 
(>10,000,000) number of people in a sector, they will not reproduce.
